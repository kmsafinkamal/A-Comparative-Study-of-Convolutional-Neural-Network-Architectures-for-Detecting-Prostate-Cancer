One of the most prevalent common cancers among men is prostate
cancer. Therefore, early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This study 
aims to detect prostate cancer using four Convolutional Neural Network 
(CNN) architectures. We evaluated our trained models and found a lower
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.9960 on the validation set indicating 
that our model can accurately detect prostate cancer in medical images. Our 
study suggests a promising prostate cancer detection model that could help 
improve patients' early diagnosis and treatment outcomes.
